As requested, this is a solution to question 4 of Assignment3 (camera)

Control:
Fire: space
Orient cannon (or move targeting cube): i,j,k,l
foward/backward spaceship: up/down
orient camera (or spaceship): q,w,e,a,s,d

Added code:
laserspin(Line70-82): update laser's quaternion. Similar as camera spin, it's called upon key pressing 

laserfire(Line84-87): passing through a boolean value to decide if the laser should be drawn

hierarchical xformation of laser and targeting cube(Line362-395)

misc: several keystroke functions
